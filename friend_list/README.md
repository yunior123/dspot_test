# friend_list

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.


Assuming this will be part of a very big application, please ensure to follow very high standards, to ensure that your code is maintainable, scalable and reliable. The code will be reviewed taking these points into account. We also request that you explain how you ensure that these points are addressed in your application, this should be delivered in a Google Doc document (in English). 
To ensure these points above, we request as well that you write Unit / Integration / UI tests for your application. 

Please make sure to use Hubstaff while working on the test. 

Please also conclude the problem of the Cards in the Casino, and create a parametrized unit test for your solution. 

In a Casino, all the decks of cards got mixed and some of the cards got lost. It is necessary to count how many full decks are in total. 

You are provided with a list of all the cards:

[
 {
    "suit": "hearts",
    "value": 2
  },
{
    "suit": "clubs",
    "value": 4
  },
 {
    "suit": "diamonds",
    "value": "J"
  },
{
    "suit": "spades",
    "value": 9
  },
 ....
]
